# Proxmox Project

## Summary

I am going to build a server that will do virtualization.
I want to move everything to my cloud, and not use something like AWS, Azure, DigitaOcean...
I'm excited to build my own server, to learn mostly Proxmox, Route OS, load-balancing, containers, networking...

## Plan

1. Order materials, then wait for arrival.
2. Put the SSD and RAM in to the NUC.
3. Install Proxmox VE.
4. Boot, and configure Proxmox VE.
5. Log in to Proxmox VE via the network, and configure everything.
6. Create the first Virtual Machine.
7. Experiment.
