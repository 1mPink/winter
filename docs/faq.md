# FAQ

#### I'm in college. Can I join this event? 

No, this event is only open to high school students.

##### Can I join the event if I'm not in the US?

Yes, this event is open to everyone. However, Hack Club Bank, the platform you'll be using to receive and spend the grant money may or may not work as well outside of North America. Using Hack Club Bank outside of the North America is still experimental. We'd love to still hear from you and will try our best to help make it work!

If you're hacking from India, check out this [guide](/india.md) for using Hack Club Bank in India.

##### What if I don't have a project idea?

Check out the [examples](/examples) for inspiration. If you're still stuck, you can ask for help in the [#hardware-party](https://hackclub.slack.com/archives/C0168BR5PDE) channel on Slack.

##### Can two people apply for the grant and then combine their grants?

Yes you can. The amount you get for the grant depends on how complex your project is. So if you team up with an IRL friend and want to build a project that costs $500, that would be acceptable. You'd share a Hack Club Bank account with your friend.

##### Is there a limited amount of grants?

At the moment Hack Club doesn't have a limited number. If we start hitting high numbers we might need to revisit it but we want to see many cool projects come out of this event!

##### Can I buy a 3D printer with the grant

You can buy parts to make one. If a 3D printer fits your budget, it could count as a tool you need for the project.

##### Do we have to build only one project or can we also build multiple mini-projects?

You can build multiple small projects as long as it costs less than $250!

##### Does the entire project have to cost less than $250?

No, but the grant is only up to $250, so you will have to personally pay the difference if it's over $250.

##### What If I use more money than I put on the PR?

If you end up needing a bit more and you haven't hit $250 all you'll need to do is hit up a member of the bank team!

##### Is there a due date for the proposal and if I can change it?

The proposal due date is the 15th of January as of now and yes you can change it before January 15th if you need to!

##### When are PRs going to be reviewed?

Within 48 hours of submitting.

##### Will we have to pay the 7% fee for Hack club Bank?

No, Hack Club Bank members have decided that we are going to waive the 7% fee or any of the wonderland hardware accounts set up on Hack Club Bank. If your project runs over the grant money and you need to deposit a bit more cash to build your project- there will be no fee!

##### Should my budget include shipping and taxes?

Absolutely! Remember to include shipping charges and taxes in your budget.
